# PythonSharePointAPI
Stuff you can use to get started using Graph API to access SharePoint stuff

Here I'm walkthing through SharePoint directory to find a file. I'm looking for files based on part of filename and which of those have the latest date modified. 

These are excel files (either .xlsx or .xlsm). I then copy a specific sheet from the excel file into a pandas dataframe.

The parameters in the json file are not the ones I used; I obscured them a bit. Hopefully they give you some idea as to what you need to change them to if you want to use them. Hit me up on Twitter if needed.

HAVE FUN.
